## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Polynomial Approximation
- Automatic degree adaptation until L²-norm ≤ 0.0007
- Removed fixed grid size to enable tolerance-controlled accuracy
- Constructor now iterates: "Increase degree to: X" until tolerance met
- Much higher accuracy polynomial approximations as foundation

### 2. BFGS Refinement Section
- Refines top 5 critical points using BFGS optimization
- Displays for each refined point:
  - Initial and refined coordinates
  - Function value improvement
  - Number of iterations
  - Position change magnitude
  - Gradient norm at solution

### 3. Enhanced Validation
- Compares both raw and refined points to expected global minimum
- Shows improvement metrics:
  - Raw solver: Distance ~1.4 to global minimum
  - After BFGS: Distance ~9.6e-5 to global minimum
  - Position improvement: ~15,000x more accurate!

### 4. Summary Statistics
- Average position correction: 1.26 units
- Average value improvement: 6.55 units
- Best value improvement: From 7.995 → 0.000 (exact global minimum)

## Example Output from Demo

```
Raw polynomial solver:
  ✗ Not found within tolerance
  Closest distance: 1.449e+00

After BFGS refinement:
  ✓ Expected global minimum FOUND!
  Distance: 9.619e-05
  Value: 0.000000
  Error in value: 3.660e-07
  BFGS iterations: 6
  Found in orthant: (-,+,-,+)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Enhanced polynomial solver with tolerance control**:
   - Automatic degree adaptation ensures L²-norm ≤ 0.0007
   - Much more accurate starting points for BFGS
   - Higher degree polynomials capture function behavior better
   - Eliminates manual grid size specification

2. **Raw vs tolerance-controlled polynomial solver**:
   - Fixed degree (4): L²-norm ≈ 0.037 (50x higher than target)
   - Tolerance-controlled: L²-norm ≤ 0.0007 (target achieved)
   - Better critical point initialization for BFGS

3. **BFGS refinement benefits**:
   - Dramatically improves accuracy (15,000x for position)
   - Typically converges in 6-16 iterations
   - Essential for identifying true minima
   - Final gradient norms < 1e-8 confirm convergence

3. **Orthant decomposition advantages**:
   - Ensures comprehensive domain coverage
   - Enables parallel processing potential
   - Overlap strategy prevents missing boundary points

## Recommendations

1. **Always use tolerance-controlled polynomial approximation**:
   - Set appropriate L²-norm tolerance (e.g., 0.0007)
   - Avoid fixed GN parameter to enable automatic adaptation
   - Let Constructor increase degree until tolerance is met

2. **Apply BFGS refinement to critical points from polynomial solver**:
   - Use gradient norm < 1e-8 as convergence criterion
   - Check both position and value improvements
   - Essential for final accuracy

3. **For global optimization, analyze all 16 orthants in 4D**:
   - Comprehensive domain coverage
   - Higher accuracy starting points lead to better final results
