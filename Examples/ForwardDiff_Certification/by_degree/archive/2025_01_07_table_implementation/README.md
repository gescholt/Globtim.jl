# Archive: Table Implementation Work (2025-01-07)

This archive contains files from the implementation of critical point tables by subdomain.

## Contents

### Test Scripts
- `test_critical_point_tables.jl` - Initial test of table generation functionality
- `test_direct_subdomain_tracking.jl` - Test showing subdomain labels are already in the data
- `test_recovery_fix.jl` - Test for recovery functionality
- `test_table_generation_simple.jl` - Simplified test for debugging module loading issues
- `verify_table_fix.jl` - Verification script for the final fix

### Documentation/Planning
- `CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive audit of the codebase
- `CRITICAL_POINTS_TABLE_PLAN.md` - Implementation plan for the table feature
- `DEBUG_RECOVERY_PLAN.md` - Plan for debugging recovery issues
- `ISSUES_TO_FIX.md` - List of issues identified during audit

### Original Implementation
- `CriticalPointTables.jl` - Original implementation (replaced by CriticalPointTablesV2.jl)

## Key Insights

1. **Subdomain Assignment**: Critical points are computed per subdomain, so they already have subdomain labels. No need to reassign after computation.

2. **Module Loading Issue**: Fixed by passing `is_point_in_subdomain` function as parameter rather than trying to load modules conditionally.

3. **Table Structure**: Each subdomain gets a table showing distances from theoretical to computed critical points across polynomial degrees.

## Final Implementation

The final implementation is in `src/CriticalPointTablesV2.jl` which:
- Generates tables for each subdomain with theoretical critical points
- Exports to CSV and LaTeX formats
- Creates summary statistics
- Integrates with the subdomain evolution plot
