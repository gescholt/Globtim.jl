# Type Optimization Summary for Globtim

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the analysis of type usage in Globtim, focusing on opportunities to use different data types (particularly rational/fraction types) to improve computational stability and performance.

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Architecture

The Globtim package follows this computational flow:

1. **Approximation Construction** (orthogonal basis)
   - Function sampled on tensorized Chebyshev/Legendre grid
   - Vandermonde matrix `V` constructed via `lambda_vandermonde`
   - Least squares solve: `(V'V)c = V'f` → coefficients in orthogonal basis
   - Result stored in `ApproxPoly` struct

2. **Basis Conversion** (orthogonal → monomial)
   - `to_exact_monomial_basis` calls `construct_orthopoly_polynomial`
   - Expands tensor products of univariate polynomials
   - Returns `DynamicPolynomials.Polynomial` in monomial basis

3. **Polynomial System Solving**
   - Monomial polynomial fed to HomotopyContinuation or msolve
   - Critical points computed and analyzed

### 2. Critical Type Safety Issues

1. **Hardcoded Float64 in `lambda_vandermonde`** (CRITICAL)
   ```julia
   V = zeros(Float64, n, m)  # Line 115 in ApproxConstruct.jl
   ```
   This prevents using arbitrary precision types throughout the pipeline.

2. **Missing Type Annotations**
   - `MainGenerate`: parameters `f` and `d` lack types
   - `compute_norm`: matrix/vector parameters untyped
   - Various internal variables lack type declarations

3. **Implicit Type Conversions**
   - Grid generation functions
   - Norm computations
   - Evaluation loops

### 3. Opportunities for Rational Arithmetic

#### High-Impact Areas

1. **Vandermonde Matrix Construction**
   - Chebyshev values at grid points are algebraic numbers
   - Rational approximations would preserve exactness
   - Critical for conditioning with high-degree polynomials

2. **Basis Conversion Coefficients**
   - Chebyshev ↔ Monomial conversion has exact rational coefficients
   - Currently using floating-point approximations
   - Example: T₂(x) = 2x² - 1 (exact rational: 2/1, -1/1)

3. **Integration/Norm Computations**
   - Polynomial integrals have exact rational values
   - L2 norms of monomials: ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1)
   - Currently approximated with floating-point

#### Medium-Impact Areas

1. **Grid Point Coordinates**
   - Chebyshev nodes: cos((2k+1)π/(2n+2))
   - Could use high-precision rational approximations
   - Better for exact evaluation

2. **Sparsification Thresholds**
   - Small coefficients could be rationalized
   - Controlled rounding preserves structure

### 4. Benefits of Fraction Simplification

1. **After Basis Conversion**
   - Common factors in monomial coefficients
   - GCD reduction before polynomial solving
   - Reduces coefficient magnitude

2. **Power-of-2 Denominators**
   - Already implemented: `closest_pow2denom_rational`
   - Improves floating-point compatibility
   - Reduces rounding errors

3. **Sparse Polynomial Representation**
   - Rational coefficients allow exact zeros
   - Better sparsity detection

### 5. Performance Considerations

#### When Rationals Help
- High-degree polynomials (conditioning)
- Exact polynomial functions
- Small dimensional problems
- When exactness is critical

#### When Float64 is Better
- Large-scale problems
- Transcendental functions
- Real-time applications
- Memory-constrained environments

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Type System (Required)
```julia
# Make lambda_vandermonde generic
function lambda_vandermonde(Lambda::NamedTuple, S::Matrix{T}; basis=:chebyshev) where T<:Real
    V = zeros(T, n, m)
    # ... rest with T instead of Float64
end
```

### Priority 2: Rational Conversion Tables
```julia
# Precompute exact conversion matrices
const CHEB_TO_MONO_RATIONAL = Dict{Int, Matrix{Rational{BigInt}}}()

function init_conversion_tables(max_degree::Int)
    for d in 0:max_degree
        CHEB_TO_MONO_RATIONAL[d] = compute_exact_conversion_matrix(d)
    end
end
```

### Priority 3: Smart Fraction Reduction
```julia
function reduce_polynomial_fractions(poly::Polynomial)
    # Find GCD of all coefficient denominators
    # Optionally reduce to common denominator
    # Simplify individual fractions
end
```

### Priority 4: Type-Dispatched API
```julia
# User-friendly interface
function construct_approximation(f, dim, degree; precision=:auto)
    if precision == :auto
        precision = recommend_precision(f, dim, degree)
    end
    # ... dispatch to appropriate precision
end
```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `test/test_type_performance.jl`:
- Type preservation tests
- Accuracy comparisons
- Condition number analysis  
- Performance benchmarks
- Rational arithmetic benefits
- Numerical stability tests

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Exact Polynomial Approximation
```julia
f = x -> x[1]^2 + x[2]^2
pol = Constructor(TR, 2, precision=RationalPrecision)
# Should give exact zero error
```

### 2. High-Degree Approximation
```julia
f = x -> sin(5*x[1])
pol = Constructor(TR, 30, precision=RationalPrecision)
# Better conditioning than Float64
```

### 3. Sparsification with Exact Zeros
```julia
pol_sparse = sparsify_polynomial(pol, 1e-10, precision=RationalPrecision)
# Exact zeros, not near-zeros
```

## Conclusion

The Globtim package has a solid foundation for multi-precision arithmetic but is currently limited by hardcoded Float64 types in critical functions. Fixing these issues and implementing rational arithmetic in key areas would provide:

1. **Improved accuracy** for polynomial approximations
2. **Better numerical stability** for high-degree polynomials  
3. **Exact arithmetic** where applicable
4. **Flexible precision** based on problem requirements

The most critical fix is making `lambda_vandermonde` type-generic. After that, incremental improvements can be made to support rational arithmetic throughout the pipeline.
