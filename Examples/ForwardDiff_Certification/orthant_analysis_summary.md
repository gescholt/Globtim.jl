# 4D Orthant Analysis Summary

## Overview

We successfully implemented 4D orthant decomposition for the Deuflhard composite function, splitting the domain into 16 orthants (2^4, not 4^2).

## Key Files Created/Updated

   - L²-norm tolerance control (0.0007)
   - Automatic polynomial degree adaptation
   - BFGS refinement with detailed convergence info
   - Fixed scope warnings
2. **`deuflhard_4d_bfgs_demo.jl`** - Fast demo with 4 representative orthants (ENHANCED)
3. **`test_orthant_decomposition.jl`** - Comprehensive test suite
4. **`simple_orthant_example.jl`** - Simple quadratic example
5. **`orthant_clarification_demo.jl`** - Clarifies 2^4 = 16 orthants concept

## Mathematical Clarification

- In n-dimensional space: **2^n orthants** (not n^2)
- 2D: 2^2 = 4 quadrants
- 3D: 2^3 = 8 octants
- 4D: 2^4 = 16 orthants
- Coincidentally 2^4 = 4^2 = 16, but the reasoning is different

## Orthant Decomposition Strategy

```julia
# For base domain centered at origin with range R
# Each orthant gets:
orthant_shift = 0.3 * R           # Center shift
orthant_center = [0,0,0,0] + orthant_shift * [±1,±1,±1,±1]
orthant_range = 0.6 * R           # Creates overlap
```

## Raw vs Refined Comparison

### Expected Critical Points (from 2D tensor products)

The 4D Deuflhard composite f(x1,x2,x3,x4) = Deuflhard(x1,x2) + Deuflhard(x3,x4) has:

1. **Global minimum**: [-0.7412, 0.7412, -0.7412, 0.7412] with f = -1.74214
2. **Local minima**: e.g., [-0.7412, 0.7412, 0, 0] with f = -0.87107
3. **Saddle points**: e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0] with f = 0

### Key Findings

1. **Raw polynomial solver** finds approximate critical points
2. **BFGS refinement** is essential for:
   - Accurate position (improves by ~100x)
   - Accurate function values (critical for identifying minima)
   
3. **Orthant decomposition** helps manage computational complexity by:
   - Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems
   - Enabling parallel processing potential
   - Ensuring no critical points missed at boundaries (via overlap)

## Performance Considerations

- Full 16-orthant analysis is computationally intensive
- Demo with 4 orthants provides quick validation
- **NEW**: Tolerance-controlled approximation ensures accuracy vs speed balance
- **NEW**: L²-norm tolerance 0.0007 provides excellent accuracy
- **NEW**: Automatic degree adaptation eliminates manual tuning
- Constructor output shows: "Increase degree to: X" until tolerance met

## Validation Results

✓ All 16 orthant sign patterns correctly generated
✓ Overlapping domains ensure boundary coverage
✓ Critical points found match expected 2D tensor products
✓ Global minimum successfully located (when its orthant is analyzed)
✓ Duplicate removal works across orthants

## Current Enhancements (Recently Added)

1. **Tolerance-controlled polynomial approximation**:
   - L²-norm ≤ 0.0007 ensures high accuracy
   - Automatic degree adaptation (no manual tuning)
   - Better foundation for BFGS refinement

2. **Enhanced BFGS integration**:
   - Starting from much more accurate polynomial solutions
   - Comprehensive convergence information display
   - Position and value improvement metrics

## Future Improvements

1. Adaptive orthant selection (analyze promising orthants first)
2. Parallel orthant processing
3. Smart initial guesses for BFGS based on 2D knowledge
4. Adaptive tolerance based on function complexity
