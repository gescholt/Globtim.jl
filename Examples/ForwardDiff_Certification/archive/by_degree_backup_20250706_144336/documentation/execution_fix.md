# Execution Fix for run_all_examples.jl

## Issue
The `run_all_examples.jl` script was not producing any output files because the individual example scripts use execution guards:

```julia
if abspath(PROGRAM_FILE) == @__FILE__
    # This only runs when the file is executed directly
    # NOT when it's included via include()
end
```

## Solution
Modified `run_all_examples.jl` to explicitly call the analysis functions after including each example file:

```julia
# Before (didn't execute):
include("examples/01_full_domain.jl")

# After (executes properly):
include("examples/01_full_domain.jl")
run_full_domain_analysis()
```

## Changes Made
1. **Line 29**: Added `run_full_domain_analysis()` after including 01_full_domain.jl
2. **Line 43**: Added `run_fixed_degree_subdivision_analysis()` after including 02_subdivided_fixed.jl  
3. **Line 57**: Added `all_results, degree_requirements, output_dir = run_adaptive_subdivision_analysis()` after including 03_subdivided_adaptive.jl

## Output Structure
When run properly, the script creates timestamped directories:
- `outputs/full_domain_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM/`
- `outputs/subdivided_fixed_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM/`
- `outputs/subdivided_adaptive_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM/`

Each directory contains:
- PNG plot files (LÂ²-norm convergence, recovery rates)
- CSV data files with detailed results
- No test or temporary files are created

## Performance Note
Currently using `DEGREE_MAX = 4` for fast testing. For production analysis, increase to 12 for meaningful convergence results.
