# Subdomain Assignment Analysis Report

## Problem Summary

All 9 theoretical critical points in the (+,-,+,-) orthant are being assigned to subdomain 1010, instead of being distributed across multiple subdomains as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Coordinate Distribution Issue

The problem stems from how the 2D critical points are distributed within the (+,-) orthant `[0,1] × [-1,0]`:

**2D Critical Points in (+,-) Orthant:**
- Point 1: `[0.507, -0.917]` - saddle
- Point 2: `[0.741, -0.741]` - min  
- Point 3: `[0.917, -0.507]` - saddle

**Coordinate Ranges:**
- X: 0.507 to 0.917 (all > 0.5)
- Y: -0.917 to -0.507 (all < -0.5)

### 2. Subdivision Boundary Problem

The orthant subdivision splits each dimension at its midpoint:
- Dimension 1: Split at 0.5 (middle of [0,1])
- Dimension 2: Split at -0.5 (middle of [-1,0])
- Dimension 3: Split at 0.5 (middle of [0,1])
- Dimension 4: Split at -0.5 (middle of [-1,0])

### 3. Resulting Classification

Since ALL 2D critical points have:
- X > 0.5 (upper half of dimension 1)
- Y < -0.5 (lower half of dimension 2)

ALL 4D tensor products will have:
- x1 > 0.5 → bit 1 = 1
- x2 < -0.5 → bit 2 = 0  
- x3 > 0.5 → bit 3 = 1
- x4 < -0.5 → bit 4 = 0

This results in binary label "1010" for every point.

## Why This Happens

### Limited 2D Critical Point Coverage

The Deuflhard function in the (+,-) orthant only has 3 critical points, and they happen to be clustered in the "upper-lower" region relative to the subdivision midpoints.

### Boundary Proximity

Two points are very close to boundaries:
- Point 1: Distance to X=0.5 boundary is only 0.007
- Point 3: Distance to Y=-0.5 boundary is only 0.007

However, even these boundary-proximate points fall on the same side of the subdivision.

## Expected vs Actual Distribution

**Expected:** Points distributed across multiple subdomains (0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111)

**Actual:** All 9 points in subdomain 1010 (upper-lower-upper-lower quadrant)

## Verification

The subdomain assignment is mathematically correct:
- Subdomain 1010 bounds: `[0.5,1.0] × [-1.0,-0.5] × [0.5,1.0] × [-1.0,-0.5]`
- All theoretical points have coordinates that fall within these bounds

## Solutions

### Option 1: Accept the Current Distribution
- The assignment is mathematically correct
- This represents the actual critical point distribution for the Deuflhard function
- Update documentation to reflect that not all subdomains will contain critical points

### Option 2: Modify Subdivision Strategy
- Use different subdivision boundaries (e.g., based on critical point quantiles)
- Create non-uniform subdivisions that better capture point distribution
- Use adaptive subdivision based on actual point locations

### Option 3: Expand Analysis Domain
- Include critical points from other orthants to get better coverage
- Use a larger domain that includes more diverse critical point locations

### Option 4: Add Synthetic Test Points
- Add additional test points to ensure all subdomains have some coverage
- Mix theoretical critical points with synthetic points for testing

## Recommendation

**Accept Option 1** - The current assignment is correct. The concentration of all critical points in subdomain 1010 is a mathematical property of the Deuflhard function within the (+,-,+,-) orthant, not an error in the subdivision logic.

This finding actually provides valuable insight into the function's behavior: the critical points are not uniformly distributed across the orthant but are concentrated in specific regions.

## Impact on Analysis

- Subdomain 1010 will have all 9 theoretical points for validation
- Other subdomains will have no theoretical points (expected behavior)
- This should be reflected in the analysis results and documentation
- The subdivision analysis is still valuable for understanding approximation quality across different spatial regions
