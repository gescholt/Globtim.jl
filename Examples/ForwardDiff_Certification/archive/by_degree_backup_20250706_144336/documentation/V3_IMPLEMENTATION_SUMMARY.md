# V3 Implementation Summary: Per-Subdomain Distance Tracking

## Overview
Successfully implemented minimal changes to add per-subdomain distance tracking to the existing degree convergence analysis. The implementation follows the minimal plan exactly.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Modules (2 files)

#### `shared/MinimizerTracking.jl`
- **Purpose**: Handle minimizer-to-subdomain assignment and distance computation
- **Key Functions**:
  - `assign_minimizers_to_subdomains()`: Maps each true minimizer to its containing subdomain
  - `compute_subdomain_distances()`: Computes distances from minimizers to computed points within each subdomain
- **Data Structure**: `SubdomainDistanceData` to store per-subdomain metrics

#### `shared/EnhancedVisualization.jl`
- **Purpose**: Extended plotting functionality with subdomain traces
- **Key Function**: `plot_distance_with_subdomains()`
  - Shows individual subdomain traces as thin lines
  - Maintains existing average and range visualization
  - Only displays subdomains that contain minimizers

### 2. Modified File

#### `examples/degree_convergence_analysis_enhanced_v3.jl`
- **Minimal Changes** (~20 lines added):
  1. Added module includes and imports
  2. Added minimizer assignment after subdomain generation
  3. Added subdomain distance data collection in main loop
  4. Modified plot function call to pass new data
  5. Renamed plot creation function to v3
  6. Added TRESH constant definition

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Per-Subdomain Tracking**
   - Each subdomain tracks distances to its own minimizers
   - Distances computed from true minimizers to nearest computed point

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Distance plot now shows:
     - **Thick orange line**: Average across all subdomains (existing)
     - **Thin orange lines**: Individual subdomain traces (new)
     - **Orange band**: Min-max range (existing)
     - **Blue line & band**: Global domain comparison (existing)
     - **Black dotted line**: Recovery threshold

3. **Modular Design**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Reusable modules for other analyses
   - Non-breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage

To run the enhanced analysis:

```julia
include("test_v3_implementation.jl")
```

Or directly:

```julia
include("examples/degree_convergence_analysis_enhanced_v3.jl")

summary_df, distance_data = run_enhanced_analysis_v2(
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],  # degrees
    16,               # grid points
    analyze_global = true,
    threshold = 0.1
)
```

## Output
The analysis creates an enhanced distance convergence plot (`distance_convergence_with_subdomains.png`) that visualizes how each subdomain converges to its local minimizers as polynomial degree increases, similar to how the L2-norm plot shows individual subdomain convergence.

## Benefits
- **Insight**: Shows which subdomains struggle to find their minimizers
- **Validation**: Confirms subdomain-based approach effectiveness
- **Minimal**: Only ~100 lines of code added across 3 files
- **Maintainable**: Clear module structure for future extensions
