# Enhanced Degree Convergence Analysis V2 - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the high-priority improvements implemented in the enhanced degree convergence analysis for the 4D Deuflhard function minimizer recovery study.

## Implemented Features

### 1. **Removed Histogram/Barplot** ✅
- The minimizer count histogram has been removed from the overview plot
- Replaced with a cleaner single-axis plot showing recovery rate percentage
- Added secondary axis for point count tracking (near minimizers vs spurious points)

### 2. **Enhanced Distance Plot with Quartile Bands** ✅
The new distance convergence plot includes:
- **Median line** with scatter points
- **Shaded quartile bands**:
  - Inner band: 25th-75th percentile (darker shade)
  - Outer band: 10th-90th percentile (lighter shade)
- **Minimum distance line** (dashed) to show best-case performance
- **Recovery threshold line** at 0.2 for reference
- **Log scale** on y-axis for better visualization of convergence

### 3. **Global Domain Comparison** ✅
Added side-by-side comparison of:
- **Subdivided approach**: 16 subdomains with targeted approximations
- **Global approach**: Single approximation over entire stretched orthant
- Both shown with median and quartile bands in different colors
- Allows direct assessment of subdivision benefits

## Data Collection Enhancements

### Enhanced Distance Statistics
```julia
struct EnhancedDistanceStats
    all_distances::Vector{Float64}
    min, median, mean, max::Float64
    q10, q25, q75, q90::Float64
    n_near, n_far::Int  # Points within/beyond threshold
    near_distances, far_distances::Vector{Float64}
end
```

### Improved Recovery Metrics
- **Per-subdomain accuracy**: 
  - 100% if subdomain correctly identifies its minimizer (or has no false positives)
  - 0% if subdomain misses its minimizer (or has false positives)
- **Global recovery rate**: Percentage of 9 true minimizers found
- **Point classification**: Separates points near minimizers from spurious points

## Key Insights from Implementation

1. **Max Distance Persistence**: The high maximum distances (~1.4) persist across degrees because:
   - Polynomial approximations create spurious critical points
   - The stretched domain (±0.1 beyond orthant) provides space for these points
   - Even high-degree polynomials can have spurious critical points far from true minimizers

2. **Median vs Mean**: Using median instead of mean provides more robust statistics, as it's less influenced by outlier spurious points

3. **Subdivision Benefits**: The comparison clearly shows that subdivision:
   - Achieves lower median distances
   - Has tighter quartile bands (more consistent performance)
   - Recovers minimizers more reliably

## Usage

```julia
# Run enhanced analysis
include("examples/degree_convergence_analysis_enhanced_v2.jl")

# Full analysis with global comparison
summary_df, distance_data = run_enhanced_analysis_v2(
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],  # Degrees to test
    16,               # Grid points
    analyze_global = true
)

# Analysis without global comparison (faster)
summary_df, distance_data = run_enhanced_analysis_v2(
    degrees, gn, 
    analyze_global = false
)
```

## Output Files

The analysis creates:
1. `enhanced_distance_convergence.png` - Main distance plot with quartile bands
2. `enhanced_l2_convergence.png` - L²-norm convergence comparison
3. `recovery_overview.png` - Clean recovery rate visualization
4. `summary.csv` - Detailed statistics by degree
5. `recovery_degree_N.csv` - Per-subdomain recovery details for each degree

## Next Steps (Medium Priority)

1. **Fix recovery rate calculation** to show more meaningful per-subdomain metrics
2. **Add spurious point filtering** based on function values (true minimizers have f ≈ 1e-27)
3. **Create distance distribution visualizations** (violin plots or histograms by degree)

## Validation

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- `test_enhanced_analysis.jl` - Tests subdomain assignment and basic statistics
- `verify_data_collection.jl` - Validates distance calculations and recovery metrics
- All tests pass, confirming correct implementation
