# Plot Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all plot improvements made to the by_degree analysis framework.

## 1. Plot Implementation Fixes

### Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **L2-norm convergence plot**: Now properly uses the `title` parameter
- ✅ **Recovery rates plot**: Added legend explaining blue/red lines and 90% target
- ✅ **Min+min distance plots**: Updated titles to differentiate between analyses:
  - Example 2: "Min+Min Distance: Fixed Degree Subdivisions"
  - Example 3: "Min+Min Distance: Adaptive Subdivisions"
- ✅ **Subdivision L2-norm plot**: Fixed disconnected nodes issue by:
  - Sorting results by degree before plotting
  - Using `lines!` for connected trajectories + `scatter!` for visible points
  - Using 16 distinct colors for each subdomain

## 2. Visual Improvements

### Min+Min Distance Plots:
- **Log scale on y-axis** for better visualization of convergence
- **Adaptive y-axis limits** based on actual data range (ymin = min * 0.5, ymax = max * 2.0)
- **Tolerance line only shown if within visible range** (not forced display)
- **Legend positioning** at top-right with frame

### Recovery Rate Plots:
- **Single domain**: Added legend with labels:
  - Blue: "All Critical Points"
  - Red: "Min+Min Points Only"
  - Gray dashed: "90% Target"
- **Subdivisions**: Split into two subplots with titles:
  - Top: "All Critical Points Recovery"
  - Bottom: "Min+Min Points Only Recovery"
  - Text annotations showing number of subdomains

### L2-Norm Convergence:
- **Single domain**: Title displayed on plot
- **Subdivisions**: 16 distinct colors using `distinguishable_colors`
- Connected trajectories for each subdomain

## 3. Plot Descriptions (New Feature)

Created `PlotDescriptions.jl` module providing textual analysis without modifying figures:

### Functions:
- `describe_l2_convergence`: Convergence analysis with reduction factors
- `describe_recovery_rates`: Success rate ranges and 90% threshold achievement
- `describe_min_min_distances`: Distance statistics and improvement factors
- `describe_subdivision_convergence`: Per-degree statistics across subdomains
- `describe_subdivision_recovery_rates`: Mean rates per degree with subdomain counts
- `describe_subdivision_min_min_distances`: Overall improvement metrics

### Example Output:
```
L²-Norm Convergence Analysis:
  Degree range: 2 to 6
  L²-norm range: 1.23e-01 to 4.56e-03
  Convergence: 27.0x reduction from degree 2 to 6
  Tolerance 1.00e-02 achieved at degree 4
```

## 4. Implementation in Examples

All three examples now:
1. Generate plots with improved visuals
2. Save plots to timestamped output directories
3. Display textual descriptions to console after each plot
4. Use more specific titles for different analyses

## 5. Key Benefits

- **Clarity**: Plots now clearly show what's being measured
- **Information**: Textual descriptions provide quantitative insights
- **Flexibility**: Tolerance lines adapt to data range
- **Distinction**: Different analyses have specific titles
- **Accessibility**: Console output provides plot insights without viewing images
