# 2D vs 4D Critical Point Analysis Summary

## Overview

This analysis compares the critical point classification between 2D and 4D cases to verify the mathematical consistency of our subdomain assignment methodology.

## Key Results

### 2D Analysis (+,-) Orthant
- **Domain**: [-0.1, 1.1] × [-1.1, 0.1] (stretched by 0.1)
- **Critical Points**: 5 total
  - 3 minimizers
  - 2 saddles
- **Subdomains**: 4 (2×2 grid with binary labels 00, 01, 10, 11)
- **Assignment**: 
  - Subdomain 01: 2 points (all saddles)
  - Subdomain 10: 3 points (all minimizers)

### 4D Analysis (+,-,+,-) Orthant
- **Domain**: [-0.1, 1.1] × [-1.1, 0.1] × [-0.1, 1.1] × [-1.1, 0.1]
- **Critical Points**: 25 total (5×5 tensor product)
  - 9 minimizers (min+min combinations)
  - 16 non-minimizers (all other combinations)
- **Subdomains**: 16 (4×4×4×4 grid with binary labels 0000-1111)
- **Assignment**:
  - Subdomain 0101: 4 points (saddle+saddle combinations)
  - Subdomain 0110: 6 points (saddle+min combinations)
  - Subdomain 1001: 6 points (min+saddle combinations)
  - Subdomain 1010: 9 points (min+min combinations)

## Consistency Verification

### ✅ Tensor Product Structure
| Type | Expected (2D²) | Actual (4D) | Match |
|------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| min+min | 3×3 = 9 | 9 | ✅ |
| min+saddle | 3×2 = 6 | 6 | ✅ |
| saddle+min | 2×3 = 6 | 6 | ✅ |
| saddle+saddle | 2×2 = 4 | 4 | ✅ |

### ✅ Subdomain Logic Consistency
- **2D**: Points assigned to subdomains based on coordinate ranges
- **4D**: Points assigned to subdomains based on tensor product of 2D coordinates
- **Verification**: 4D subdomain labels directly correspond to 2D tensor products

### ✅ Mathematical Relationships
1. **Total Points**: 2D has 5 points → 4D has 5² = 25 points
2. **Minimizers**: 2D has 3 minimizers → 4D has 3² = 9 minimizers
3. **Unique Assignment**: Every point assigned to exactly one subdomain in both cases
4. **Boundary Handling**: Consistent lexicographic ordering for boundary points

## Key Insights

### 1. Subdomain Mapping
The 4D subdomain labels directly encode the tensor product structure:
- `0101` = (2D subdomain `01`) × (2D subdomain `01`) → saddle+saddle
- `0110` = (2D subdomain `01`) × (2D subdomain `10`) → saddle+min
- `1001` = (2D subdomain `10`) × (2D subdomain `01`) → min+saddle
- `1010` = (2D subdomain `10`) × (2D subdomain `10`) → min+min

### 2. Critical Point Distribution
- **2D**: Minimizers concentrated in subdomain 10 (lower-right region)
- **4D**: Minimizers concentrated in subdomain 1010 (tensor product of 10×10)
- **Pattern**: Minimizers appear in regions where both coordinate pairs favor the minimizer locations

### 3. Validation of Methodology
- The unique assignment function works correctly in both dimensions
- Boundary overlap issues are properly resolved using lexicographic ordering
- The corrected assignment eliminates multiple counting problems

## Conclusion

✅ **All consistency checks passed!**

The 2D vs 4D analysis confirms that:
1. Our subdomain assignment methodology is mathematically sound
2. The tensor product structure is correctly implemented
3. The corrected assignment function eliminates boundary overlap issues
4. Critical point classification is accurate across dimensions

This validates the reliability of our 4D analysis results and provides confidence in the subdomain-based approach for higher-dimensional critical point analysis.
