# GitLab Project Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a lightweight project management system using GitLab's native features for managing mathematical testing code in Julia/Maple.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Create directory structure
- [ ] Set up label taxonomy
- [ ] Create issue templates
- [ ] Document workflows

## Phase 2: Automation
- [ ] Epic progress tracking scripts
- [ ] Sprint management tools
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Reporting automation

## Phase 3: Optimization
- [ ] Custom dashboards
- [ ] Time tracking integration
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] Team onboarding docs

## Key Decisions
- Use labels for epic management (no premium features needed)
- Milestone = Sprint (2-week cycles)
- Three main boards: Development, Epics, Priority
- Markdown-based documentation
