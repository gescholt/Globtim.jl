# Implementation Summary: First Plot Task

## Overview
I've implemented the analysis plan from `first_plot_task.md` which focuses on simplified polynomial construction and visualization of convergence patterns.

## Created Files

### 1. `examples/simplified_subdomain_analysis.jl`
**Purpose**: Implements both plots from first_plot_task.md - L²-norm convergence and minimizer histogram.

**Key Features**:
- Removes adaptive algorithm complexity
- Uses fixed polynomial degrees [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Same number of samples (GN=16) for each subdomain and degree
- Leverages Globtim's built-in BFGS optimization results (no need for separate Optim/ForwardDiff dependencies)
- Generates two visualizations:
  1. **L²-norm convergence plot** (single-axis):
     - 16 subdomain L²-norm curves (semi-transparent red, opacity 0.5)
     - Full domain L²-norm curve (blue, thicker line)
     - All curves on same scale for direct comparison
  2. **Minimizer convergence histogram**:
     - Combines results from all 16 subdomains (not just full domain)
     - Light blue bars: Number of theoretical minimizers recovered by BFGS optimization across all subdomains
     - Dark blue bars: Number that are also classified as minima by Hessian analysis
     - Shows how subdomain decomposition improves critical point recovery
     - Removes duplicate points found in overlapping regions

**Output**:
- `l2_convergence_simplified.png` - L²-norm convergence visualization
- `minimizer_convergence_histogram.png` - BFGS convergence histogram
- `subdomain_results.csv` - Detailed subdomain L²-norm results
- `full_domain_results.csv` - Full domain L²-norm results  
- `minimizer_convergence_results.csv` - Histogram data

### 2. `examples/minimizer_convergence_analysis.jl` (Standalone Version)
**Purpose**: Alternative standalone implementation of the histogram plot.

**Note**: The histogram functionality is now integrated directly into `simplified_subdomain_analysis.jl`, making this file optional. The integrated version uses Globtim's built-in BFGS results, while this standalone version performs its own BFGS optimization.

### 3. Updated `run_all_examples.jl`
**Changes**: Modified to run both analyses in sequence:
1. Tests shared utilities
2. Runs simplified subdomain analysis (first plot)
3. Runs minimizer convergence analysis (second plot)

## Key Simplifications from Original Code

1. **No Adaptive Algorithm**: Fixed degrees across all subdomains
2. **Direct L²-norm Access**: Uses `pol.nrm` field directly
3. **Simplified Structure**: Focuses on core polynomial construction
4. **Reuses Infrastructure**: Leverages existing shared utilities and Globtim's built-in BFGS optimization
5. **No External Dependencies**: Uses Globtim's `analyze_critical_points` instead of separate Optim/ForwardDiff

## Implementation Details

### L²-norm Calculation
- Fixed issue with `pol.infos` (doesn't exist)
- Now correctly uses `pol.nrm` field from ApproxPoly struct

### Constant Naming
- Avoided naming conflicts by using `MINIMIZER_DEGREES` in second analysis
- Both analyses can run in the same session

### Visualization Strategy
- First plot: Shows spatial convergence patterns
- Second plot: Shows critical point recovery quality

## Usage

Run the complete analysis:
```bash
cd Examples/ForwardDiff_Certification/by_degree
julia run_all_examples.jl
```

Or run individual analyses:
```julia
include("examples/simplified_subdomain_analysis.jl")
run_simplified_analysis()

include("examples/minimizer_convergence_analysis.jl")
run_minimizer_convergence_analysis()
```

## Expected Results

1. **L²-norm Convergence Plot**:
   - Shows 16 curves (one per subdomain) converging as degree increases
   - Full domain curve typically converges faster than individual subdomains
   - Patterns reveal which spatial regions are harder to approximate

2. **Minimizer Histogram**:
   - Shows how well BFGS finds theoretical minimizers
   - Inner bars indicate successful polynomial approximation of critical points
   - Higher degrees should show better critical point recovery

## Notes

- The implementation follows the task requirements closely
- Reuses existing code infrastructure where possible
- Focuses on clarity and simplicity over optimization
- Ready for testing and further refinement
