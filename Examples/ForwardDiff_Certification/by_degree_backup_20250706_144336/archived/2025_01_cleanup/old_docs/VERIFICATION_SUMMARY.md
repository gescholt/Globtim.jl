# Verification Summary: Subdivided Analysis Implementation

## ‚úÖ Verified Components

### 1. Domain Setup ‚úì
- Main domain correctly defined as (+,-,+,-) orthant: [0,1]√ó[-1,0]√ó[0,1]√ó[-1,0]
- Bounds match expected orthant configuration

### 2. Subdivision Logic ‚úì
- 16 subdomains correctly generated by splitting each dimension at midpoint
- Each subdomain has range 0.25 (half of 0.5 per dimension)
- Subdomains cover entire orthant without gaps or overlaps
- Center grid: [0.25, 0.75] √ó [-0.75, -0.25] √ó [0.25, 0.75] √ó [-0.75, -0.25]

### 3. Theoretical Point Distribution ‚úì
- 9 theoretical critical points loaded correctly:
  - 1 min+min point
  - 2 min+saddle points  
  - 2 saddle+min points
  - 4 saddle+saddle points
- **KEY FINDING**: All 9 points fall in subdomain 1010 only!
- Other 15 subdomains have NO theoretical points

### 4. Fixed Bugs
- Fixed `plot_critical_point_recovery_histogram` ylims error when max_theoretical = 0
- Now handles subdomains with no theoretical points gracefully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

### 1. Theoretical Point Concentration
- All theoretical points concentrated in single subdomain (1010)
- This explains why min+min distance plot shows only one curve
- Other subdomains only contribute L¬≤-norm data

### 2. Low Polynomial Degrees
- Current max degree 6 is too low to capture all critical points
- Convergence shows only 9/16 subdomains reach tolerance at degree 6

### 3. Missing Visualizations
- No visual representation of subdomain boundaries
- No diagnostic showing point distribution across subdomains

## üìã Implementation Strategy Confirmed

The implementation correctly follows the intended strategy:

1. **Domain**: (+,-,+,-) orthant properly defined
2. **Subdivision**: 16-way split correctly implemented
3. **Independent Analysis**: Each subdomain gets its own polynomial approximation
4. **Point Tracking**: Theoretical points correctly assigned (all in 1010)
5. **Statistics Aggregation**: Combined results properly collected

## üöÄ Improvement Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Increase polynomial degrees** beyond 6 to achieve convergence in all subdomains
2. **Add theoretical point distribution visualization** to show concentration in subdomain 1010
3. **Consider different test functions** with more distributed critical points

### Medium Priority
1. **Add subdomain boundary visualization** for spatial understanding
2. **Create heatmap** showing computational difficulty by subdomain
3. **Add progress indicators** for long-running analyses

### Low Priority
1. **Optimize parallel processing** of subdomains
2. **Add memory usage tracking** per subdomain
3. **Create interactive plots** for exploring results

## Summary

The implementation is fundamentally correct but reveals an interesting characteristic of the 4D Deuflhard function: all critical points in the (+,-,+,-) orthant are concentrated in a single subdomain (1010). This explains the observed behavior where:
- L¬≤-convergence shows 16 distinct curves (one per subdomain)
- Min+min distance plot shows only 1 curve (only subdomain 1010 has min+min points)
- Gaps in plots occur when polynomial construction fails for certain degree/subdomain combinations

The current maximum degree of 6 is insufficient for full convergence across all subdomains.
