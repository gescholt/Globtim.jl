# L2 Convergence Plot Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary

The user reported that all 16 curves in the L2 convergence plot are identical, suggesting a fundamental issue with the data structure or processing. Investigation revealed the root cause and identified multiple related issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Theoretical Points Are Clustered in One Subdomain

**Finding**: All 9 theoretical points for the (+,-,+,-) orthant fall within only one subdomain (1010) out of 16 total subdomains.

**Evidence**:
- Subdomain 1010 bounds: `[(0.5, 1.0), (-1.0, -0.5), (0.5, 1.0), (-1.0, -0.5)]`
- All theoretical points have coordinates in ranges:
  - x1: ~0.507 to ~0.917 (within [0.5, 1.0])
  - x2: ~-0.917 to ~-0.507 (within [-1.0, -0.5])
  - x3: ~0.507 to ~0.917 (within [0.5, 1.0])
  - x4: ~-0.917 to ~-0.507 (within [-1.0, -0.5])

**Result**: Only subdomain 1010 has theoretical points; all other 15 subdomains are empty.

### Secondary Issue: Plotting Function Duplication

**Finding**: The plotting function creates 16 identical curves by duplicating the single subdomain's data.

**Evidence**: CSV files show only subdomain "1010" results, but plots show 16 curves.

## Detailed Investigation Results

### 1. Subdomain Generation
- ✅ **Correct**: 16 subdomains properly generated with appropriate bounds
- ✅ **Correct**: Subdivision logic works as designed

### 2. Theoretical Point Loading
- ✅ **Correct**: 9 theoretical points loaded for orthant
- ✅ **Correct**: All points within orthant bounds [0,1] × [-1,0] × [0,1] × [-1,0]
- ❌ **Issue**: Points naturally cluster in one subdomain due to their mathematical properties

### 3. Subdomain Filtering Logic
- ✅ **Correct**: `is_point_in_subdomain` function works properly
- ✅ **Correct**: Point containment checks are accurate
- ❌ **Issue**: No theoretical points in 15 of 16 subdomains

### 4. Analysis Processing
- ✅ **Correct**: Empty subdomains are skipped (line 62 in adaptive analysis)
- ❌ **Issue**: This creates sparse results dictionary

### 5. Data Aggregation
- ❌ **Issue**: Plotting function doesn't handle sparse results correctly
- ❌ **Issue**: Creates duplicate curves instead of single-domain plot

## Theoretical Point Distribution

### The 9 Theoretical Points:
1. [0.507, -0.917, 0.507, -0.917] - saddle+saddle
2. [0.507, -0.917, 0.741, -0.741] - saddle+min
3. [0.507, -0.917, 0.917, -0.507] - saddle+saddle
4. [0.741, -0.741, 0.507, -0.917] - min+saddle
5. [0.741, -0.741, 0.741, -0.741] - min+min ⭐
6. [0.741, -0.741, 0.917, -0.507] - min+saddle
7. [0.917, -0.507, 0.507, -0.917] - saddle+saddle
8. [0.917, -0.507, 0.741, -0.741] - saddle+min
9. [0.917, -0.507, 0.917, -0.507] - saddle+saddle

**Key Insight**: These points are tensor products of 2D Deuflhard critical points from the (+,-) orthant, which naturally cluster in the upper ranges of each dimension.

## Solutions

### 1. Immediate Fix: Correct Plotting Logic

**Fix**: Modify plotting function to only plot subdomains with actual results.

```julia
# Filter out empty subdomains before plotting
non_empty_results = Dict{String, Vector{EnhancedDegreeAnalysisResult}}()
for (label, result_vec) in results
    if !isempty(result_vec)
        non_empty_results[label] = result_vec
    end
end
```

### 2. Alternative Approach: Adaptive Subdivision

**Option A**: Use adaptive subdivision that focuses on regions with theoretical points.

**Option B**: Use different subdivision strategy:
- Cluster-based subdivision around theoretical points
- Adaptive mesh refinement based on point density

### 3. Enhanced Visualization

**Option A**: Show single-domain plot when only one subdomain has results.

**Option B**: Create hybrid visualization:
- Main plot: Single domain with results
- Inset: Spatial distribution of theoretical points
- Annotation: Explanation of clustering

## Recommended Actions

### Short-term (Immediate)
1. **Fix plotting function** to handle sparse results correctly
2. **Add warning message** when most subdomains are empty
3. **Update plot titles** to indicate actual number of active subdomains

### Medium-term (Design Improvement)
1. **Implement adaptive subdivision** based on theoretical point distribution
2. **Add spatial visualization** showing point clustering
3. **Create hybrid plots** that show both convergence and spatial distribution

### Long-term (Framework Enhancement)
1. **Develop automatic subdivision strategy** selection
2. **Add point density analysis** to guide subdivision
3. **Create comparative visualization** showing different subdivision approaches

## Code Changes Required

### 1. Enhanced Plotting Utilities Fix
```julia
# Add filtering logic to plot_l2_convergence_dual_scale
function plot_l2_convergence_dual_scale(results; kwargs...)
    # Filter out empty subdomains
    non_empty_results = filter(p -> !isempty(p.second), results)
    
    if length(non_empty_results) == 1
        # Single domain case
        return plot_single_domain(first(non_empty_results), kwargs...)
    else
        # Multi-domain case
        return plot_multi_domain(non_empty_results, kwargs...)
    end
end
```

### 2. Analysis Enhancement
```julia
# Add point distribution analysis
function analyze_point_distribution(subdivisions, theoretical_points)
    distribution = Dict{String, Int}()
    for sub in subdivisions
        count = count_points_in_subdomain(theoretical_points, sub)
        distribution[sub.label] = count
    end
    return distribution
end
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests** for sparse result handling
2. **Integration tests** with real subdivision data
3. **Visual verification** of corrected plots
4. **Performance testing** with various point distributions

## Conclusion

The "identical curves" issue is caused by theoretical points clustering in one subdomain combined with plotting logic that duplicates sparse data. The fix involves:

1. Correcting the plotting function to handle sparse results
2. Providing clear visualization of the actual data distribution
3. Potentially redesigning the subdivision strategy for better point distribution

This reveals that the subdivision approach works correctly but may not be optimal for this specific mathematical function where critical points naturally cluster in certain regions.
